The project assigned is to develop an Android mobile application to

enable clinical appointment booking and cancellation, as opposed to 

appointment booking via telephonic or internet means. This will help 

reach out to the numerous stakeholder of the institute. 

The app, being developed for Android, was built using the Android 

Development Tools provided by Google. 

The app consists of a home screen with four buttons, for Appointments, 

Cancellation, About Us and Contact Us along with a photo of the 

institute. Appointments is either new appointment or returning, 

and details such as Name, Phone Number, Email etc. or MR 

number are collected using a form and these details are sent to 

appointment@lvpei.org using the JavaMail library without user 

intervention. A similar procedure exists for Cancellation, with only MR 

number being sent.

About Us and Contact Us contain the corresponding information and 

details. 

The App was developed and tested for different devices and screens, and 

the UI was tested against the randomized user input test or the Monkey 

test. The App was exported and was prepared for publishing and handed 

over to the institute.
